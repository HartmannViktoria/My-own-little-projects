Hi!

I am Viki Hartmann, career changer, future front-end developer and web developer.

In this folder you will find exercises that I have prepared as practice based on my studies.
In a few years time I'm sure I'll be smiling about this, as you are now, but every start is difficult, but I'm not giving up! My goal is to be a good frontend developer and I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty with small tasks for the greater good! :) 
Learn, learn, learn!
Practice, practice, practice!
I will never be done :D

(In the task descriptions you will find the links to the images/videos I used.)
